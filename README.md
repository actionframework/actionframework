ActionFramework
===============

Ready for action? Ready, set, go!

ActionFramework is a web application framework for Ruby.   
It's meant for rapid and fun development of your application.

Because of that is easy understable and easy to use and customize.    
Want some documentation? Read the source code.

# Why do I need to read the source code?

Currently ActionFramework is in an alpha stage of the framework. This means that it is under heavy development and not really ready to use in production envoirements.

Because it is in the alpha I have not had the time to create the documentation, but I think the source code is not very hard to understand, and ActionFramework includes a very nice commandline utility, so you can run "afw new projectname" and you are ready to go!

# Installation

You can install this framework with the following command:

    [sudo] gem install actionframework
